                            <h3>What is Hawaiian Art Journey?</h3>
                            <p><strong>HAJ organizes one week art workshops on the Big Island of Hawaii
							at the Kona Village Resort.</strong> HAJ was started in order to bring
							artists of all levels to the Big Island to study with the some of the
							best instructors available for a concentrated and intense stay.<BR>
                            </p>
                            <h3>What is HAJ trying to provide for artists?</h3>
                            <p>We seek to provide everything so that nothing comes between you and your
						advancement! Essentially, we are trying to provide a high end art retreat
						that immerses the student in a beautiful, relaxing new area where everything
						is taken care of in order to help the artist jump start his or her creative
						processes, rejuvenate, and advance in art.<BR>
                            </p>
                            <h3><a name="konavillage"></a>What is the Kona Village Resort? </h3>
                            <p>The Kona Village was originally a fishing village on the Kohala Coast
						but about 40 years ago it was transformed into the world renowned retreat
						you now see. (link to web cam at KV) The philosophy behind the resort is
						simple but luxurious. It differs from everything else on the islands by:</p>
                            <OL>
                                <LI>Offering bungalow style hale in different secluded places around the
							82 acre resort, as opposed to hotel rooms. (link to accommodations KV)
                                <LI> Discouraging the use of intrusive technology and other distracting
							devices.
                                <LI> Offering an exceptionally high degree of personalized service.
                            </OL>
                            <p>The grounds have great natural beauty and the resort has a very easy
						going, friendly vibe to it. Since it's located on the Kohala coast, the
						dry side of the island, it's almost always sunny and nice year round.</p>

                            <h3>Why The Kona Village for an art retreat?</h3>
                            <p> The Kona Village actually chose HAJ as a way to support the arts. We
						fill empty Hale on a space available basis and are generously underwritten
						by the owners in order to make this possible. We were looking for a place
						to hold workshops, so we jumped at the opportunity because<em> it is</em> such a
						great place for artists.</p>
                            <h2><a name="program"></a>Program</h2>
                            <h3>Who teaches for HAJ and how are they selected?</h3>
                            <p>Our teachers are generally selected by referral and interview. Here are
						our standards and how we determine  &quot;the best&quot;: The instructor
						must be an excellent and accomplished artist, have a demonstrated commitment
						to teaching, and have a website capable of introducing themselves and their
						ideas. Dedication and a good sense of humor are important! We have instructors
						teaching in many different mediums and materials; oils, watercolors, pastels,
						sculptors, and gourd painters!</p>
                            <h3>What skill level is expected of me?<BR>
                            </h3>
                            <p>Different classes are crafted for different levels of advancement. Please
						read the workshop description and, if in doubt, call
						the instructor. Classes are designed for absolute beginners all the way
						to practicing professionals. <a href="workshops.html">Check our listings.</a></p>
                            <h3>How are the workshops structured? </h3>
                            <p> Structure is up to each teacher and differs in each workshop. By and
						large there is lecture, demonstration, coaching, discussion and exercises,
						and critique. All of these instructors have experience with what works,
						from which you shall benefit. Classes typically tend to run for six sessions
						at around 3-5 hours a piece, after which the instructor generally sticks
						around for some further one on one time should the student wish.</p>
                            <h3>What supplies do I need for the workshops?<BR>
                            </h3>
                            <p> <strong>Supplies are listed by workshop and are generally your responsibility.</strong> Call the instructor with queries. Plan ahead and FedEx. TSA don't like
						your bottles of thinner. Be advised. </p>
                            <p> Some things which would be unusually hard to find, difficult to ship,
						etc. may be provided with the class, if so it will be clearly listed as
						such in the materials list in the workshop description. <BR>
                            </p>
                            <h3>Are supplies available locally?<BR>
                            </h3>
                            <p>After the loss of our nice art store there is not a lot available. Have
						one of the mail order houses (Dick Blick, etc.) fill your list and FedEx
						to the Kona Village Resort with your name and class date on the package.
                                <br />
						The Kona Village's address is:</p>

                            <p class="noindent"><strong>Queen Ka'ahumanu Highway<BR />
						Kailua-Kona, Hawaii 96740</strong></p>
                            <h3>What else is suggested that I pack?</h3>
                            <p><strong>Comfortable light clothing</strong> - the temperature hardly ever drops below
						70 F, even at night, and it hardly ever rains, so jackets and jeans generally
						aren't necessary. A light sweater for the night, maybe.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Slippers</li>
                                <li>Bathing suite</li>
                                <li>Sunscreen!</li>
                                <li> A relaxing book for after an intense day.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>The Kona Village has a little shop for things like drinks, aspirin, sunscreen,
						etc. <BR>
                            </p>
                            <h3>Can I sell my art at the resort?</h3>
                            <p>Yes though there are strict rules about sales in place by the Kona Village.

                            <p><strong>We try to provide all the basics except for air fare and art

                            <h3>How much does the Kona Village Resort typically cost?</h3>
                            <p>Kona Village is known for it's wonderful location and service but also
						for the people who choose it. They are accomplished and successful. When
						you see the KV price page you can see it is easy to be here for a week
						and spend $7,000. Right now there are specials on Orbitz and Expedia that
						with tax are over $4,200 for what we have in HAJ, and that is without our
						world class Instructors!</p>
                            <h3>Are discounted rates available to returning artists?</h3>
                            <p>Yes. Just call or email for details.</p>
                            <h3>If I recruit others do I get a discounted rate?</h3>
                            <p>Yes. Bring a friend and get $100 off. What a deal :) Just call or email
						for details.</p>
                            <h3>Are there other ways to pay besides PayPal?</h3>
                            <p>Yes. Checks, cash, whatever, just call or email - we're flexible, but
						please open a Pay Pal account (please). All of my bookkeeping is through
						Pay Pay. Other arrangements can be made but they, by necessity, cost more.</p>
                            <h3>If I wish to stay longer at the resort can I continue to get the discounted
						rate?</h3>
                            <p>Yes. You will get a favored rate but not necessarily HAJ's. You must
						speak to the front desk either before your stay or during.</p>

                            <h3>Where are the best airfare rates available?</h3>
                            <p>Hawaiian Airlines generally provides the best rates and specials to the
						islands from the West Coast. United is also competitive. Sometimes flying
						into Oahu or Maui, then finding a an inter-island special between the islands
						is the least expensive. Vickie Kiebler of Punahele Travel (877-320-0647)
						has always been good at finding me a competitive rate.<BR>
                            </p>
                            <h3>Am I provided transportation from the airport and back?</h3>
                            <p><strong>We are happy to pick you up if we have a name, flight, and time
							of arrival.</strong> Call, or better yet e-mail the Kona Village front desk with this info after
						your class fills and you have a flight. The Kona Village picks up its guests
						from the airport so a car rental is unnecessary.</p>
                            <h3>If I choose a double occupancy hale who will I board with?<BR>
                            </h3>
                            <p>Our rates are based on two to a hale. If you chose the double hale rate
						you will paired with someone of the same gender but without regard to age
						or politics. If you wish to room with a friend just call or email your
						request.</p>
                            <h3>What if I have to cancel my reservation?</h3>
                            <p>Cancellations are possible up until 30 days before arrival but please
						read here: Reservations</p>
                            <h3>What if the workshop I've signed up for doesn't get the required number
						of people?<BR>
                            </h3>
                            <p>Full refund except for 3% Pay Pal fee in some cases. So bring friends
						and let's get going. Please read the reservations page and call if in question.</p>

                            <p><strong>The Kona Village has excellent service and the chief will accommodate
						to practically anything.</strong> One needs but ask. If it's of major concern, though,
						feel free to contact us, or even better, email the Kona Village about it. </p>
                            <h3>Is the Kona Village Resort handicap accessible?</h3>
                            <p>You bet, but you should call the Kona Village first and they will make
						sure everything goes smoothly for you. They're very good at that sort of

						I am open to suggestions.</p>

                            <p>Ooooo... All kinds of good stuff. Should you wish to explore the island
						before or after your workshop there are great things
						to be seen. Hiking and ocean activities, Mauna Kea – the snow covered mountain,
						Waipio – the lush valley, the Volcano National Park, and much more. Two
						good websites for ideas are:
