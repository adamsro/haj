                      <div id="main_left_padding">
                        <h3> You call your bungalows 'hale.'  Is that singular or plural?</h3>
                        <p>There is no &quot;s&quot; in the Hawaiian language. Therefore &quot;Hale&quot; is both singular and plural.</p>
                        <h3>Why don’t the hale have air conditioning? </h3>
                        <p>The constant sea breezes, trade winds and ceiling fans are a wonderful and completely sufficient substitute for A/C. </p>
                        <p>With screen doors and abundant louver windows for cross-ventilation you  experience the feel of an island paradise. Without A/C you will not  hear the intrusive hum of A/C units competing with the sounds of  birds, surf and rustling palm leaves. Extra fans are always available  should any guest need additional air ventilation.</p>
                        <h3>Are there really no radios or televisions in the hale?</h3>
                        <p>Most guests are amazed at how easy it is to break TV habits. If you  have favorite programs, record them to watch when you get home. In the  meantime, renew relationships with your spouse, your significant other,  your family, and meet new people. Without television and radio, people  find they actually talk to each other at Kona Village.</p>
                        <p>The object of the policy is to maintain the peaceful serenity of a  Hawaiian village, not disturbed by the unwelcome sounds of radio or TV  coming from a nearby hale or chaise lounge at the beach or pool. </p>
                        <h3>How can I keep up with the news?</h3>
                        <p>Every morning at breakfast,  you'll find a New York Times summary along with the NYT crossword  puzzle. They will give you a digest of big events and some sports news.  The Kona Village boutique also carries the daily Honolulu Advertiser.  Other newspapers-The Wall Street Journal, New York Times, LA Times, SF  Chronicle-are available but delayed one day.</p>
                        <p>There are also two computers with web access in the Concierge Office which are available to guests, complimentary.</p>
                        <p>There's no reason to feel completely out of touch, but many folks find  themselves happily drifting away from current events after just a few  days in the Village. That's a wonderful by-product of life in the  slow-lane. </p>
                        <h3>Is it true that you don't permit guests to use cell phones outside of their hale?</h3>
                        <p>It's true. Whenever guests are talking on a cell phone outside of their  hale, they are gently reminded of the Village's policy. This preserves  a quality experience for all guests who appreciate not having to listen  to other's conversations while they are enjoying their relaxation. </p>
                        <h3>Does that apply to using a laptop?</h3>
                        <p>Kona Village is a place to step back in time and relax. If you must  work you are asked to do so in the privacy of your hale. There is no  wireless internet connection available at Kona Village and there are no  data ports in the hale. A high-speed internet connection for laptops is  available in the Concierge Services department if you must work. </p>
                        <h3>I'm an avid SCUBA diver. What does Kona Village offer?</h3>
                        <p>Kona  Village Ocean Adventures offers one and two tank dives from our Dive  Boat that is anchored right in Kahuwai Bay at the Village. No loading  of equipment and driving to another location to board a dive vessel is  required. More than 20 dive spots are within a short distance of the  Village with superb diving. Our dive master, Jimmy Kilbride, is a  veteran diver who has mapped shipwrecks on the Anegada reef system in  the British Virgin Islands and worked as an assistant project manager  for Marine Archaeological Ventures, Ltd. He also worked with  Jean-Michel Cousteau and the Cousteau Society's Project Ocean Search to  teach people about the underwater world. In 1991, Jim joined the  Cousteau Society full time as an expedition diver. We're fortunate that  Jimmy has now called the Big Island - and Kona Village - home for  several years. We have dive packages as well as all the necessary  equipment for a memorable experience, including DPV's (Dive Propulsion  Vehicles). SCUBA certification is also offered for first time divers or  for those who may have let their certification slip.</p>
                        <h3>What are some of the in-room amenities?</h3>
                        <p>In-room, you'll find a small refrigerator that is stocked with a  complimentary selection of bottled water, sodas, and canned juices. A  coffee maker, 100% Kona Coffee beans and grinder are also available.  Tropical bath amenities include shampoo, conditioner and lotion. A  variety of magazines are provided and a small flashlight is in every  room for the evening stroll back to your hale after dinner. </p>
                        <h3>With so many return guests, how will I feel as a 'first timer'?</h3>
                        <p>The staff and even other guests are as friendly and welcoming as you'll  ever find. Someone said, &quot;Kona Village is really different-guests  actually talk to each other,&quot; to which someone replied, &quot;Of course we  do-we're all family.&quot; If you treat the staff in a friendly manner,  they'll respond in kind, and when you come back, they'll recognize you,  and you, too, will be in for your share of attention and hugs. By the  way, the staff do not wear name tags, on the theory that if they treat  you well, you'll learn and remember their names as they will yours. </p>
                        <h3>The Village is 82 ocean front acres.  Is there a lot of walking involved or is there transportation available?</h3>
                        <p>At check-in and check-out guests are escorted via a golf-style cart  with sufficient cargo space for luggage, and the passengers. The walk  from either the far north or far south end of the resort to the public  areas may take 5 to 10 minutes but most guests welcome the walk for the  exercise and often compare the walk to and from their hale like a  stroll in a beautiful park. </p>
                        <p>If walking is a problem, you may request a hale nearer the public areas  and reservations will do what they can, based on availability, to  accommodate your needs. (Refer to property map.)</p>
                        <p>If you have great difficulty walking, there are options. You can  arrange to use a motorized scooter which the resort keeps on hand. Or  you can arrange with the concierge to have a bellman pick you up at a  given time to bring you to dinner each evening. There are also hale  with wheelchair access, and there is even a wheelchair with over-sized  balloon tires that can be used to access the beach and Kahuwai Bay. </p>
                        <h3>Can I remain anonymous even if I'm famous?</h3>
                        <p>We have many  regular guests who are well known and recognizable. You may not remain  anonymous, but famous or not-guests and staff will visit with you just  as they would anyone else. </p>
                        <p>On the other hand, if you seek privacy, that will be respected. At Kona  Village it's easy to integrate into the &quot;family,&quot; but it's also easy to  remain aloof, if that's your preference. </p>
                        <h3>If it's a long walk to the office, what do I do if there's an emergency?</h3>
                        <p>Every hale has a red alarm box near the bed that will signal the office  staff who will send security for immediate assistance. Also, most  people now have cell phones and could call the office for help. </p>
                        <h3>What about tipping?</h3>
                        <p>A 15% gratuity is already included in your Hawaiian Art Journey fee.</p>
                        <h3>What if we miss an included meal due to a day trip to the volcanoes or to play golf?</h3>
                        <p>You may pre-order (by 6pm the evening prior) a box lunch which will be  available for pick-up at the time you specify the following morning  prior to your excursion from Kona Village. Or, if you prefer, the  resort will give you lunch vouchers valid for meals at a number of  popular restaurants on the island. </p>
                        <h3>How do I rent a car from the village?</h3>
                        <p>Hertz rental cars are  available at the Village, and the concierge can set it up for you.  24-hours prior notification is appreciated and will help ensure a  vehicle for you on the day of your choosing. </p>
                        <h3>What about transportation to church on Sunday?</h3>
                        <p>The concierge will arrange a taxi. </p>
                        <h3>The Sunfish and Laser sailboats, wind-surfing, and stand-up  paddle boards and the outrigger canoe look like great fun. Will the  beach staff teach me how to use them?</h3>
                        <p>For these types of water-sports equipment, a one-time instructional  lesson is required to ensure your safety. After your lesson, use of the  equipment is complimentary for the remainder of your stay. Use is  always contingent on safe ocean conditions. </p>
                        <h3>Do you offer tennis at Kona Village?</h3>
                        <p>The Village has 3 tennis  courts which are lit for nighttime play as well. A daily clinic and  round robin as well as use of the tennis courts are all complimentary.  Rackets, balls, and even shoes (limited supply) are available  complimentary in case you forgot or didn't want to carry your own.  Private tennis instruction is available from our Tennis Professional,  Andy Klug, or his staff. (Fee applies for private instruction). </p>
                        <h3>Do you have a lu'au dinner and show and if so, is it also included?</h3>
                        <p>Guests may choose to go to our Wednesday aha'aina (lu'au) called Hula Mana and/or our Friday aha'aina called Savai'i.                        </p>
                        <p>Our aha'aina are also open to the public but seating preference is  given to Kona Village guests. The buffet menu includes pig roasted in a  traditional imu (earthen oven), poi, salads, fruits, vegetables,  contemporary foods (fish, chicken) and tasty desserts. </p>
                        <p>Hula Mana primarily features the music, dance and chants of Hawaii,  while Savai'i features the music, dance and chants of Polynesia. On  Friday's some foods are also cooked in a traditional above-ground oven  called an umu, as well as in the imu. </p>
                        <h3>I have friends on the Big Island.  Can I invite them to join me for lunch?</h3>
                        <p>Certainly. Just go to the office and have them put your friends' names  on the Village Gate's guest list so they will be able to join you </p>
                        <h3>What do you do when it rains?</h3>
                        <p>While the Village only gets about ten inches of rain per year, there  are times when storms come in and it can rain vigorously. There are  umbrellas in every hale and in the dining rooms. Of course, all meals  are served indoors when it's stormy. Generally, these types of weather  patterns move away very quickly leaving the Village sparkling in the  sunshine the next day. </p>
                        <h3>Do you sell stamps?</h3>
                        <p>No, but your letters can be mailed by the office and the postage  charged to your hale. However, all Kona Village postcards are mailed  free of charge.</p>
                        <h3>What should I pack?  What should I wear?</h3>
                        <p>Kona Village, as  with most of Hawaii, is very informal. We do prefer that gentlemen wear  long pants at dinner, but it is also acceptable to wear walking shorts,  a collared shirt, and of course, always something on the feet.</p>
                        <p>During the day - at breakfast and lunch - footwear and swimwear cover-ups are fine.</p>
                        <p>Aloha shirts, shorts and sandals are the most common ensemble for men,  and of course women have a much wider range of possibilities. Wear  what's comfortable. A light jacket for after sunset is appropriate,  particularly in the winter months. </p>
                        <h3>What's the weather like?</h3>
                        <p>The climate in Kona is as near perfect as you're going to get. The  temperature rarely goes above the 80s or below the 70s, (Fahrenheit).  Annual average rain is ten inches. Sea breezes come up late morning to  cool things down along the shore and the wind usually goes down with  the sun. </p>
                        <h3>Can I play golf next door at Hualalai?</h3>
                        <p>Yes, Kona Village guests can play at the Hualalai Golf Course. The  greens fees are $250 and $75 for club rental if needed. Concierge  Services can assist with tee times at the Hualalai Golf Course as well  as more than a dozen other championship golf courses within short  distance from Kona Village. For avid golfers the Village Golf  Experience package can insure you get the best of golf and  accommodations. </p>
                        <h3>On our last day we're scheduled to take the redeye home.  When do we absolutely have to leave?  </h3>
                        <p>Checkout  time is 12-noon. However, if your hale is not scheduled for a new  arrival that day, you can request a late departure for an additional  charge. You're also welcome to stay for an additional meal, like  dinner, at the usual charge for that meal. Otherwise you can just  remain on property until time to go to the airport, which is only six  miles (10-15 minutes) away.</p>
                        <h3>What about helicopter tours?</h3>
                        <p>Village concierge can arrange helicopter tours of the island. You will  be taken by golf cart to our heliport, where the helicopter will pick  you up right at the resort. When you return, the cart will be waiting  to return you to our front drive area. </p>
                        <h3>Does the store carry sundries such as toothpaste, sun block, feminine supplies, etc.?</h3>
                        <p>Yes, our well-stocked Hale Ho'omau boutique has sundries, souvenirs, clothing, tee's, Hawaiian crafts and more. </p>
                        <h3>Does the store carry books, like novels?</h3>
                        <p>Yes, a few, but the  Concierge Office also has a book exchange - books that have been read and  donated by other guests and you are welcome to help yourself. </p>
                        <h3>If I don't bring a laptop am I cut off from web access?</h3>
                        <p>There are two computers with high speed web access available in the  Concierge Office, so you can access the web during regular hours,  complimentary. </p>
                        <h3>Kona Village is so different from other resorts. How do I know it's for me?</h3>
                        <p>We  can't speak for the individual, but for many, many guests, Kona Village  is a place to slow down, to go back in time to a Hawaii that is more  leisurely, more sensuous, and more restful than the intense, fast-paced  life of everyday.</p>
                        <p>In the Village, guests spend time at the fitness center, playing  tennis, exploring the petroglyphs, jogging the paths, and of course  snorkeling, sailing, kayaking-taking advantage of all the amenities or  signing up for an adventure aboard the Ribcraft. </p>
                        <p>For first timers to the island, they can sign up for helicopter tours,  horseback riding, hiking tours or rent a car for a day or two to  explore on their own.</p>
                        <p>Either way, with enough time spent at Kona Village, a transformation  begins to happen, and guests soon realize that there is virtue in just  being, in soaking it in, enjoying the beauty of the surroundings and  the casual friendliness of staff and other guests. They soon become  selective, and choose the snorkeling OR the sailing, OR whatever,  knowing there is plenty of time to indulge in whatever they want to do;  or, they can do nothing at all which can be equally exhilarating. Many  close, long-term friendships are forged at the Shipwreck Bar over  tropical drinks and free popcorn!</p>
                        <p>If you are logo conscious and enjoy being part of &quot;the scene&quot; the  Village may not be right for you. Here you can be yourself while truly  relaxing for the first time. Disconnect to reconnect</p>
