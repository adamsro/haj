	  <h1>Pastels in Paradise<h1><h2> by Kelly Borsheim</h2>
	  <h5>Class from
April 17 to April 22, 2011</h5>
	  <h4>Class Description:</h4>
<p>Enjoy a week at the <strong>Kona Village Resort</strong> on the <strong>Big Island of Hawai'i</strong> while creating colorful art with pastels. <a href="http://borsheimarts.com" target="_blank"><strong>Artist Kelly Borsheim</strong></a> brings her oil painting, classical drawing, and sculpting training to her pastel art and she will share lots of these skills with you. </p>
<p>Pastels are pure pigment and without oils or solvents, pastels are the traditional medium used to create permanent art, as well as clean (Nature friendly) street art.  Spend a week with a real <a href="http://borsheimarts.com/streetpainting.htm" target="_blank"><strong><i>madonnara</i></strong> (Italian street painter)</strong></a> - Kelly Borsheim. </p>
<p>She will guide you through some drawing and observation techniques, as well as sharing tips on making your 2-dimensional art look more sculptural.  We will talk about color and design and help you develop your voice.  Improve your drawing skills.  Students will work from live settings around gorgeous sites on the island, from photos as desired, 
	and even from <a href="https://www.hawaiianartjourney.com/models.php" target="_blank"><strong>a live model</strong></a> during this week of exploration and creativity. </p>
<p>The setting is sure to inspire and the <a href="http://www.konavillage.com" target="_blank"><strong>Kona Village Resort</strong></a> will take care of making you comfortable and keeping you well fed.  Awaken your senses and get engaged.  Hone your artistic voice.</p>
<p>Students do not need to have had prior art experience, although some drawing skills will be helpful.  Even experienced artists will appreciate the time away from the rigors of their usual life and the ability to create without concerns of cooking, washing, or much else, saving you time and money. </p>

<h4>Suggested Materials:</h4>
(updated 20 January 2010)

	<ul>
		<li>pastels (pastel pencils optional)</li>
		<li>charcoal sticks (not compressed)</li>
		<li>rubber eraser</li>
		<li>stomps &amp; small sponges (cosmetic sponges on a stick work well)</li>
		<li>tracing paper (not for what you might think)</li>
		<li>colored sharpie pen -- red or blue (other than black)</li>
		<li>drawing pencils</li>
		<li>sketchbook</li>
		<li>Pastel papers -- prefer Wallis, Sennelier, or PastelBords</li>
		<li>Carrying case for all materials + personal items (water, snacks, etc.)</li>
		<li>easel</li>
		<li>drawing board + clips</li>
		<li>paintbrushes with short tips (clean, try to avoid used oil brushes):  short bristles seem best</li>
		<li>Wet-Ones or at least paper towels (clean your hands)</li>
		<li>Camera, if you have one (certainly optional)</li>
		<li>Two pieces of cardboard slightly larger than the size of your largest drawing paper/board.</li>
		<li>Shipping tape</li>
	</ul>

<h4>Details:</h4>

	<ul>
		<li>Pastels:  bring what you have or buy a kit with about 30 (minimum) colors in full range.  Then add singles of 
		dark greens, red/burgundies, blues, and black.  Rembrandt-brand black is the best black -- the most black of all the brands.  It is great!</li>
		<li>Rubber eraser -- the kneadable kind, brand _______ preferred</li>
		<li>stomps &amp; charcoal -- at least two or three of each, but if you enjoy charcoal, bring more of that.</li>
		<li>Tracing paper - helpful if it is at least the size of your drawing paper or boards</li>
		<li>drawing pencils - what you are most comfortable with</li>
		<li>Sketchbook -- a portable size that you like (for me, I prefer to draw larger than small, so 8x10 is min., but they are heavier) - a nice bonus is the kind in which a page will rip out (can use it without the book on your drawing board)</li>
		<li>Pastel drawing papers:  Both Wallis and Sennelier make a sand-paper type toothed paper that is great for pastels.  
		Tooth is the more important thing (tooth is the term to describe a rougher surface that can hold materials well).  
		I also like Ampersand's PastelBord.  Sizes = 9 x 12, 12 x 16 Check the internet  and/or call Vicky Kibler of Punahele Travel who specializes in Hawaii. She is toll free at (877)320-0647 or vtravel@hawaiintel.netCheck the internet  and/or call Vicky Kibler of Punahele Travel who specializes in Hawaii. She is toll free at (877)320-0647 or vtravel@hawaiintel.net-well.  Bring 2-4 pieces.</li>
		<li>Drawing board should be larger than the papers you bring to work on, but not so large that you cannot pack aboard a plane.</li>
		<li>Easel:  travel easel preferred, table easel if you have nothing else.  Or contact Hawaiian Art Journey or Kelly Borsheim -- there may be one available for you in Hawai'i.</li>
	</ul>
	
<strong>*If you are having any trouble finding supplies, please contact the instructor and she can bring what you need to buy.</strong>

<p><strong>*Travel tip:</strong>  Kelly often either chooses a suitcase that has proper proportions for her drawing board 
and other large flat materials, or packs a thinner rectangular box that is strong and large enough to pack the 
art and boards and wraps her clothes around the art materials, using the clothes like bubble wrap.
Kelly often chooses an airline based on their carry-on policy.</p>



<h4>About the Instructor:</h4>

<p><strong>Kelly Borsheim</strong> has worked as a full-time professional artist since January 2001. She is a sculptor (of stone and in bronze), but also paints and draws. Her primary subject is the human figure, but all of Nature inspires. She also works with pastels as a <a href="http://borsheimarts.com/streetpainting.htm" target="_blank">&quot;madonnara&quot; (Italian street painter)</a> when she is in Europe.</p>
<p>Kelly's artworks are now in private collections throughout the United States and in Australia, Canada, Italy, France, The Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and New Zealand.</p>

<h4>Optional Trip to <a href="http://www.nps.gov/havo/index.htm" target="_blank">Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park</a></h4>

<p>Kelly would like to visit the volcano park -- to go hiking and exploring and perhaps take photographs or draw as inspiration for more ambitious artworks.  
Mostly, she just wants to be in a zone of Nature that she has never seen before.  The Volcano Park is approximately a 3-hour drive (one way) from the Kona Village Resort -- so a long day trip.</p>

<p>If this interests you, Robert Adams of Hawaiian Art Journey is working up a package deal. Details will be posted shortly . . .</p>

<p>Extra detail from Robert:  If your instructor wants additions made available to you, you will be given a &quot;promo code&quot; to enter before paying and the cost will be added.  For example Kelly Borshiem is thinking of an additional day and night with an escorted tour to the volcano.  In this example only the first 5 applying will fit in the escorted van.
