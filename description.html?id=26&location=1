	  <h1>PASTELS ARE PAINT... NOT CHALK<h1><h2> by Nance McManus</h2>
	  <h5>Class from
May 14 to May 21, 2011</h5>
	  <p>Depending on your level of experience with pastels or painting I hope to help you bring out the best in your paintings so that you won't have to rely on anyone but yourself to get pigment to surface. I will paint a few demonstrations to show the flexibility of pastels and hopefully bring some new thought process to your painting repertoire.</p>

<h4>Prerequisites:</h4> 
<p>A desire to learn and change the way you think.</p>

<h4>Objective:</h4>
<p>Laugh out loud at the joy of the new experience.</p>
 
<p>I also plan on a few "slide shows" to talk about pastels in art history and also better composition for your paintings.</p>
 
<h4>Materials:</h4>
<p>Any and all supplies connected with painting in pastels. Oil pastels are not the subject for this class. I will be happy to work with students individually through the internet on augmenting their supplies. For those students who have not painted in pastels before I will be offering a set of pastels that I have chosen for the especially for this class.</p>


<h4>About Nance:</h4>
<p>"It was 1993 when I moved back home to New Mexico after living almost 10 years in Europe. I still hear the voices of not only the living artists but also the historical masters of art that I studied with in England, France, and, especially, Italy.</p>

<p>The biggest change for me has been winning a scholarship from the Scottsdale Artist's School to study with Howard Post .I ended up rushing headlong into a passion with pastels. The freedom I have whilst working in pastels keeps me enthusiastic about painting all the time.</p>

<p>In recent years I have taken courses with master pastelists Duane Wakeham, DougDawson and Richard McKinley, equine artist Sam Savitt, and fundamental anatomyfor sculpture with retired orthopedic surgeon Dr. Wilfred Stedman. My nudes are included on Ruth Block's "Painting the Figure in Watercolor" videos. My good friend and mentor Bill Herring helps me keep my aesthetic river within its creative banks.</p>

<p>In 2011 a book of my pastel paintings of birds: "A PASSION FOR PASTELS" is planned to be published. I am continually challenged by the images of birds, their colour, and motion. Birds are built form for function and it makes them compositionally exquisite.</p>

<p>I hope to continue my work in pastel painting as well as teaching pastels. Color and composition keep me studying more and developing better paintings. I remember back in university wandering around trying to 'find' something to paint. Now there are just not enough hours in the day to paint it all.</p>	  <hr width="90%" size="1" />
